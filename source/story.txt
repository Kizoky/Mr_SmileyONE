*These are extremely early, and WIP "story"; it may change, or be even completely discraded*

Mr. Smiley II will offer a "story telling" which is mostly built on cancer. Yes, when I meant cancer, things like that cause cancer.

Users will be asked If they wish to skip the cutscenes, or the whole beginning intro, however It will be cut into sequences, so the player won't have to
go through the unskippable dialogue, and just go to the specific dialogue, If by any chance, he/she died somehow during the cutscenes.. ;)

It's also worth mentioning that this story won't have any meaning at all. Of course, It will have a standard story, but everything built on it will be true cancer.
Like childish humour, 1000 year old jokes that makes anyone puke and irritate (triggering), unexpected events, and so on.

Of course, this will be DISABLED by default on MULTIPLAYER.
It can be reenabled in the server via a cvar. (It doesn't exist yet, nor the ACS scripts which consists the stories)
The "skippable" sequences will most likely will rely on the host of the server (or the first player who entered the server, who knows.)
Due to limitations It will just be simply "played" as players can respawn without reloading the whole level (reloading a whole level results in reloading the ACS scripts too, d'uh.)

ATM there aren't any story.
I'll avoid putting REALLY offensive black humour (like involving Kurt Cobain from Nirvana, nobody likes that.)
